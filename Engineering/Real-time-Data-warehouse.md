# Real Time Data Warehouse
I guess `real time` and `warehouse` should not be coexisted. 
Data warehouse is the collection of data set which is subject-oriented, integrated, non-volatile, and time variant.

Here the `real time` means that we use stream processing technology to ingest data into the data warehouse. This is different from how traditionally the data is ETL into the data warehouse.
